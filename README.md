# Employee Tracker


Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. My task is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.



## Demo



## Technologies that were used

This tracker required the installation of inquirer, mySQL2, console.table, javascript and Node.js

## Installation
clone from Github and then do an npm i to install all the dependencies
